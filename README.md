## Introduction
I am an engineer. 
I don't have much skill, so I made it for studying. I don't have much Git skills. 
This repository was created to improve my Java and Python skills and to learn how to use Git. 
If you have something you would like to develop, please feel free to contact us.

## What we want to make
It is still in the planning stage.
I'm involved in web development, so I'm thinking of using Spring Boot or Angular.
